**Dr. Allison E. Mann, Assistant Professor** 
<br/>I'm a biological anthropologist interested in how microbes can help us to better understand human evolution, health, history, behavior, and diversity. My research lies at the intersection of microbial ecology, biological anthropology, biomedical sciences, and computational biology. I am particularly interested in the biotic and abiotic factors that shape host-associated microbial ecosystems both in living and past populations.
